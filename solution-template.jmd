# Problem 1

## Problem 1.1

```julia
using GraphRecipes, Plots

A = [0 1 1 1;
		 0 0 0 1;
		 0 0 0 1;
   	 	 0 0 0 0]
	
names = ["Plant", "Land Treatment", "Chem Treatment", "Pristine Brook"]
shapes=[:hexagon, :rect, :rect, :hexagon]
xpos = [0, -1, -0.25, 1]
ypos = [1, 0, 0, -1]

graphplot(A, names=names, markersize=0.15, markershapes=shapes, markercolor=:white, x=xpos, y=ypos)
```

## Problem 1.2
```math
100 m^3/d of wastewater * 1kg/m^3 of YUK in the wastewater = 100 kg/d YUK 
x1 + x2 = 100 m^3/d
1-0.005(x2) = 0.8
x2 = 40, x1 = 60
Total Price:
(60^2)/20 + 1.5(40) = $240/d

```
